**Selected Game:** Q-Bitz

**Project Description**  

  * In this project, we are going to implement a table game called "Q-bitz".
  * Our aim is to create the game according to the principles of object oriented programming. 
  * The game will be implemented in Java. 

**General**

  * It is a game which player challenged to constitute geometric figures with given cubes. Every cube has different shapes on every side of cube.

**Modes**

 * First of all game divided into three parts as easy, medium and hard. In easy mode there is 16 cubes, in medium there is 25 and the hard mode has 36 cubes. 
 

  After selecting the mode, and as game proceeds difficulty will increase. To increase difficulty modes are used. There are three different modes at the game:
 
   * In first mode, player only arrange cubes to form the geometric figure on the card
   
   * In second mode, players roll all of their cubes on the table like dice. Using the cubes as rolled, players place as many cubes as possible in the tray to recreate the pattern shown on the card. 
   
   * In last mode, player will see the card for a limited time, they will memorize the card while this time. Then they will arrange cubes to form the geometric cube without looking to figure.

**Purpose**

  * Each cube has 6 different figures in each of their surfaces. Player aims to arrange cubes according to given design in a specific time.

  * Player get scores according to each cube that placed successfully and their remaining time when they finish the game, and loses point according to each unsuccessful trial.
